title: Selecting Scientific Tools
summary: >
  There is a universe of computational and other scientific tools out there. How do you pick which ones to use?
---

This page started as a lab meeting discussion of how to choose among different options for scientific tools (mostly focused on programming).

## Question Framing

* When should I learn python/R/Stan/etc.?
* How does {tool x} integrate into my workflow?
* If I don't learn {tool x}, what am I doing instead?
* What are the benefits for knowing how to use {tool x}
* What are the benefits for learning how to use {tool x}

## Identify Alternatives

* some possible scenarios
  - I have a specific research problem that doesn't appear to solvable with my current toolset
  - Lots of people are using {tool x}, and I don't want to be left behind
  - No one else is using {tool x}, and I want to be the leading expert in my lab/department/field
* what are some other considerations beyond solving my specific problem
  - speed
  - generality
* how do I find out about other options?
  - google +3
  - twitter +3
  - literature search 
  - seminar talks, conferences (people tend to be a little more "in the weeds", more receptive for engagement & dialogue)
  - workshops
* what are the people around me using?
  - peers, colleagues, collaborators
  - similar enough level for learning/teaching 

## Evaluate the utility of knowing a new tool

My language-agnostic concluding thoughts. Choose tools that:<br>1) Have strong communities around them<br>2) Are proven but adaptive, so you can use them long-term<br>3) Facilitate persistent reproducibility, esp. w/ your future self</p>&mdash; Thomas J.

## properties of communities to consider:
* communities to avoid (non-inclusive, wrong level)
* asking about what communities are set up around tools
* how diverse is the steering committee for the tool
* what are the practices of the community?
* If you are going to spend time in a community, will you be able to grow and take on leadership roles? (is that important for you)

## What is the long-term trajectory of a tool:
* is it actively being developed?
* established history of developers
* support for older versions


## Evaluate the utility of learning a new tool

* humans are habit-forming
  - defer learning new tools --> (decades later) "I'm too old to learn {tool x}"
  - always learning new tools --> never get around to using anything in practice
* exposure to new communities builds your professional network
* exposure to new ideas gives added context to what you already knew before
* "learning tools" is also a skill! (which means you can practice it and get better)
* "if you don't use it, you lose it" - 


## Things to keep in mind

Decision making is difficult (but it is a skill you can practice and improve on!)

* imperfect knowledge
  - no information source is incomplete
  - information sources aren't completely tuned to your individual situation
* outcomes are imperfectly measured
  - how useful was learning {tool x}? (no ideal way to measure this)
  - no measurement of what would have occurred with an alternative
* limited time/attention
  - spending (more) effort to improve decisions can also be suboptimal

* when to abandon bad decisions (sunk cost fallacy)

## Tips

* find good heuristics
  - be aware of biases (cognitive and otherwise)
  - reflect on past decisions (successful and unsuccessful)
* engage in deliberate practice
  - identify appropriate goals
  - evaluate outcomes
  - get targeted feedback
  - repeat
* embrace failure
  - "People don't fail, processes do"
  - debug your processes (learn from mistakes, aim for long-term growth)
* learn to fail fast
  - for large/complex projects - is {tool x} suitable long-term?
  - test whether the {tool x} addresses the most difficult aspect of the project
    - if this doesn't work, it is better to know sooner!
* exposure vs. learning
  - goal-oriented or not?
