## Non-UF individuals driving UF vehicles

The general rule is that only UF employees can drive UF vehicals.

However, there are several ways to override this default:

1. Registered volunteers can drive UF vehicles
2. Individuals contracted through UF can drive UF vehicles if the contract explicitly states that the contracting organization is responsible for providing insurance related to operating the vehicles.
3. UF has a system for purchasing supplementary insurance for individual vehicles to allow them to be driven by specific identified individuals who are not employees.

Talk to your departmental operations person for (1) (currently Cameron Carter for those of us in WEC).
Brian Hunt in [Environmental Health & Safety](https://www.ehs.ufl.edu/about/contacts/occupational-safety-risk-management/) can help with the details in both cases (2) and (3).
