  Guidelines for lab social events
---

A few times each year the lab will get together for social events outside of normal work hours. Most frequently these events involve dinner at Ethan and Morgan's house and group dinners at conferences.

1. These events are completely voluntary and are not important for your professional development as a weecologist.
2. Significant others, children, and service animals are welcome.
3. The lab code of conduct applies to these events.
4. Morgan and Ethan will take care of food and drinks. If you have any dietary requirements please let them know.
