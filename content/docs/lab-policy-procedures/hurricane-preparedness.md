## Science/lab

1. Everything on your computers should have off-site backups (you should have these already, but if not, now is the time to do it).
2. The most valuable/sensitive things in the lab should up off the ground (we've experienced flooding from more minor rain events in the past) and stored in the most protected areas 
    * e.g, moving Portal data and computers into the dry lab away from windows
