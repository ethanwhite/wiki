Be bold, but not reckless  
Prefer rough answers to the right questions over precise answers to the wrong ones  
There is no one "right way" to do science, not even your way  

Prioritize science over credit, but credit everyone who contributes  
Recognize and credit all aspects of the scientific process  
Don't be territorial, there is too much work to do to fight over who does what  

Train the next generation of scientists, and the previous one  
Help make science more diverse and inclusive  
Be generous  

Treat other scientists like you would want to be treated  
When you screw up, and you will, apologize and do better  
Don't punch down  

Talkin' ain't doin'  
Remember that saying No is just saying Yes to something else  
Choose the path that advances knowledge as quickly as possible  
That often means stopping the ideal from being the enemy of the good  

Good science comes from happy people  
Work in the way that works best for you  
Take care of yourself and those around you  

Open is better than closed  
Share knowledge and tools broadly  
But recognize that not everything should be open  

There are many versions of success  
You define success for yourself  
Your priorities, strengths, and goals will help you find your path  

It's all going to be OK
