title: Lab Tools
summary: >
  The standard set of tools we use in the lab for communication, coding, writing, etc.
---

There is a general lab tool kit for a variety of tasks. A shared set of tools makes collaboration within the group easier because: 1) everyone knows how to use them; and 2) we've selected them over the years because we have found them to be effective for both local and remote collaboration. For tools involved in direct collaboration (e.g., Google Docs, GitHub) these tools should be used unless a specific decision has been made by the entire team to use a different tool set. For tools used directly only by individuals (e.g., RStudio) these are only recommendations.
