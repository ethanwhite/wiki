This is a summary of the 2018-10-10 lab meeting where we discussed coding practices. The [full notes](https://hackmd.io/K4ARCohDQN2YTj6Reb3Vtw) are available online.

## Desired Qualities:
* completeness
  - code for all the figures and analyses
  - external dependencies documented
* readable
  - uses good standards for code style
  - comments help guide navigation to different parts
* (re)usable
  - description of how to run everything, few changes needed to run it all
  - examples for functions
  - functions written to be flexible (e.g. less dependence on "magic numbers" and hard-coded parameter values)

## Practices:
* linter (for style)
* tests (to check functions, could also provide simple examples)
* pair programming checks for readability
* documentation
* refactoring core code into reusable packages
* containers

## Action Items:
* training (and organizing it)
* toolchain (linter, tests, development tools)
* workflow and organization
* regular practices
